In love with the maiden, the flower of winter
Lowbrow children, grow of the inland
How many times heart's gone through the grinder?
Wherever you look, there's a painful reminder

Singing a love song, words of a stranger
The howling miller, never to face her

Temple of the evil, temple of the weak
No one knows how bad he feels
Late-night innuendo, temptation of the key
Live with the black sheep, baby, live with me

Insanity, blessing for those born to hate you
Burned by the embers of love, it is so cruel
Howling the night, for the sun of the midnight
Serving the people, condemned to eternal

Night of the lost song, words of the stranger
The howling miller, never to face her

Temple of the evil, temple of the weak
No one knows how bad he feels
Late-night innuendo, temptation of the key
Live with the black sheep, baby, live with me

Temple of the evil, temple of the weak
No one knows how bad he feels
Late-night innuendo, temptation of the key
Live with the black sheep, baby, live with me

Temple of the evil, Temple of the weak
No one knows how bad he feels
The late-night innuendo
Live with the black sheep, baby, live with me
