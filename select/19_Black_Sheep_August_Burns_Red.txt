You've fallen captive to what you thought would save you
What you thought would clean your slate
You're in the thick of it now (In the thick of it now)
And you have swallowed the hook
What's done is done
We'll continue on with or without you
Pain must exist in order for healing to survive
Neither one will ever serve their purpose alone
Neither one will ever serve their purpose alone
You've fallen in love with a dream you've never had (You've never had)
You've fallen in love with a surreal way of living
To late to wake, farewell and good luck to you
See you at the end
Too late to wake, to lay too waste
I guess this is farewell
I'm throwing in the towel
This is my goodbye
Don't worry
We saw through your trickery, and were coming out alive
See you at the end
What was once your life is now lifeless
What was once your life is now your jail cell
What was once your life is now lifeless
What was once your life is now your jail cell
